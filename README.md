# Sorting Algorithms Implementation 🚀

This repository contains the implementation of three fundamental sorting algorithms: **Bubble Sort**, **Selection Sort**, and **Quick Sort**. The project demonstrates how these algorithms process a specific dataset step-by-step to achieve a sorted array.

## 📋 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the **Advanced Programming** course. The main goal is to analyze and implement sorting logic manually and programmatically.

### Algorithms Covered:
1.  **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
2.  **Selection Sort**: An in-place comparison sort that divides the list into two parts.
3.  **Quick Sort**: An efficient, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm using a pivot.

## 🔢 Input Data
The algorithms were tested on the following dataset (derived from University ID):
```python
Input Array: [17, 103, 16, 35, 20, 22]
Sorted Output: [16, 17, 20, 22, 35, 103]
