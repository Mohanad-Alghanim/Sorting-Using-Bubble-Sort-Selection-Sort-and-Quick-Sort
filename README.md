Here is the scientific and academic explanation of the three algorithms in English, avoiding mathematical symbols and notations, focusing instead on the methodological description and performance characteristics.

1. Bubble Sort Algorithm
Classification: A sequential sorting algorithm based on adjacent comparison.

Scientific Mechanism: This algorithm operates on the principle of adjacent comparison. It performs a linear scan of the list from the beginning, examining two neighboring elements at a time.

Comparison Process: It verifies whether the preceding element is greater in value than the succeeding one.

Swapping: If the precedence condition is met (the former is larger than the latter), the two elements exchange positions in memory.

Iteration: This process continues along the length of the list. By the end of the first full pass, the element with the maximum value will have "bubbled up" to settle in its final correct position at the end of the list. These passes are repeated for the remaining elements until it is confirmed that no further swaps are required.

Performance Description: This algorithm exhibits quadratic performance; meaning the execution time increases with the square of the number of input elements, rendering it inefficient for large datasets.

2. Selection Sort Algorithm
Classification: A sorting algorithm based on positional selection and minimizing memory write operations.

Scientific Mechanism: This algorithm logically divides the list into two regions: a sorted region (initially empty) and an unsorted region (containing all elements).

Scanning and Searching: In each iteration, the algorithm performs a full linear scan of the entire unsorted region to locate the element with the absolute minimum value.

Positioning: Once this global minimum is identified, its position is swapped with the very first element of the unsorted region.

Expansion: Following the swap, this element is considered part of the sorted region. The search boundary is then advanced forward, shrinking the unsorted region, and the process repeats until the unsorted region is exhausted.

Performance Description: This algorithm also demonstrates quadratic performance in all scenarios, as it is compelled to scan all remaining elements during every step to find the minimum, regardless of whether the list is partially sorted or not.

3. Quick Sort Algorithm
Classification: A recursive algorithm employing the "Divide and Conquer" methodology.

Scientific Mechanism: Unlike the previous methods, this algorithm does not rely on sorting adjacent elements directly but rather on structural decomposition of the list.

Pivot Selection: The process begins by selecting a specific reference element known as the "pivot."

Partitioning: The elements of the list are redistributed based on their relationship to this pivot. All elements smaller than the pivot are moved to one side, and all elements larger than the pivot are moved to the other. Upon completion of this step, the pivot occupies its correct and final position in the sorted sequence.

Recursive Execution: The same process is applied independently and recursively to the left sub-list and the right sub-list generated by the partition. This subdivision continues until the sub-lists are reduced to single elements, which are inherently sorted.
